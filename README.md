Here is my individual form projectt: https://glacial-temple-16550.herokuapp.com/

For the development I used: React for front-end, Express and Node for back-end.

For field validation I used: Availity-reactstrap-validation library for react.

For maps I used: Google-maps-react library for react and google map developer documentation.

For captcha I used: React-google-recaptcha library for react.

For testing I used Selenium and tested the following form fields Last Name, First Name, Street, Suite, City, State, Zipcode, Education, Income, Phone, Email, Password, Checkbox, and Submit button Fields.
In the attachment please find screen shots of the results of the automated testing: It contains all logs of testing.

For this work I was helped by: I did the project by myself.

For WWW server I used: Heroku and Set it up by following a YouTube tutorial.
